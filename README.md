# Vue JS Boilerplate 

Hi, this is a vue js boilerplate with webpack, 
already configured for your needs.

### Install 

Go ahead and make a new directory in which you would like
to hold your application locally, go ahead and 
clone this boilerplate with the following command.

`git clone https://github.com/BenjiBoy13/Vue-Boilerplate.git`

After the repo is cloned go into the directory
and run the following commands.

`npm install`

`npm run start`

This should launch the application on a webpack local server
and in there you will see all the things you need to know
about the architecture of the boilerplate.
